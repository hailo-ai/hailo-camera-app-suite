===============================
Hailo15 C++ Example Application
===============================

Overview
========

This application serves as reference code for developers who wish to build an end-to-end application on Hailo15 that integrates Hailo's AI inference capabilities and other hardware accelerated features. 
The application demonstrates how to assemple a native C++ pipeline with the following features:

- Integration with Media Library vision Frontend
- Integration with hardware acclerated encoders (H264, H265)
- Image cropping and resizing (tiling) using hardware accelerated DSP
- Inference using Hailort Async API
- Image overlay (OSD) using hardware accelerated DSP
- DMA buffer utilization
- Streaming to a remote server using RTSP

The reference shows how a user can integrate such features in a multi-threaded pipeline that maintains zero-copy behavior for high performance.


Running the Application
=======================

The applicaton will come pre-compiled and ready to run on the Hailo15 platform as part of the release image.

To run the ai_example_app application, follow these steps:

1. On the host machine, run a gstreamer streaming pipeline to capture video feed from the ethernet cable.
        Enter the following command in the terminal of the host machine:
    
        .. code-block:: bash
    
            $ gst-launch-1.0 udpsrc port=5000 address=10.0.0.2 ! application/x-rtp,encoding-name=H264 ! 
            queue max-size-buffers=30 max-size-bytes=0 max-size-time=0 leaky=no ! rtpjitterbuffer mode=0 ! 
            queue max-size-buffers=30 max-size-bytes=0 max-size-time=0 leaky=no ! rtph264depay ! 
            queue max-size-buffers=30 max-size-bytes=0 max-size-time=0 leaky=no ! h264parse ! avdec_h264 ! 
            queue max-size-buffers=30 max-size-bytes=0 max-size-time=0 leaky=downstream ! videoconvert n-threads=8 ! 
            queue max-size-buffers=30 max-size-bytes=0 max-size-time=0 leaky=no ! fpsdisplaysink text-overlay=false sync=false
    
        This will start the streaming pipeline and you will be able to see the video feed on the screen after starting the application in the next step.

2. On the Hailo15 platform, run the executable located at the following path:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ ./apps/ai_example_app/ai_example_app

You should now be able to see the video feed with the inference overlay on the screen.

Extra Options
-------------

Some extra flags are available to run the application with different configurations:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ ./apps/ai_example_app/ai_example_app --help
            Usage:
            AI pipeline app [OPTION...]

            -h, --help                  Show this help
            -t, --timeout arg           Time to run (default: 60)
            -f, --print-fps             Print FPS
            -l, --print-latency         Print Latency
            -c, --config-file-path arg  Frontend Configuration Path (default: 
                                        /home/root/apps/ai_example_app/resources/configs/frontend_config.json)

Note that you have the option to change the configuration file path for the vision pipeline configurations: **--config-file-path**. 
A second json is provided with the default that can be used to enable low-light enhancement (denoising).

    .. note:: 
        In the current configuration, the application does not automatically change 3AConfig when enabling low-light enhancement. If you
        choose to run with this configuration, you will need ot adjust the 3AConfig manually.

    If you do need to change the 3AConfig, you can copy the one provided in **/usr/lib/medialib/sensors/** (note that imx678 is chosen as the sensor type here): 
    
    .. code-block:: bash

        $ cp /usr/lib/medialib/sensors/imx678/kit/4k/isp_profiles/denoise/3aconfig.json /usr/bin/3aconfig.json
    
    Then run the app with the new configuration:

    .. code-block:: bash
    
            $ ./apps/ai_example_app/ai_example_app --config-file-path apps/ai_example_app/resources/configs/frontend_config_denoise.json

    You can revert the 3AConfig back to the default by copying the original file back:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ cp /usr/bin/3aconfig_imx678.json /usr/bin/3aconfig.json

As you experiment with the application you may want to adjust the configurations through this flag.


Application at a Glance
=======================

Now that you are able to run the application, let's discuss what you are seeing.
Below you can see the pipeline that the application is running:

.. image:: docs/readme_resources/pipeline.png
    :alt: Application Pipeline
    :align: center

This may look like a lot at first, so we will break it down into smaller peices later. For now the key takeways are:

- The pipeline outputs 3 streams: two of just video (HD and SD), and a third (4K) with the inference overlay.
- The AI pipeline is comprised of two stages:
    - The first stage performs yolo object detection (person and face classes) on a tiled stream
        - Netwrork: yolov5s_personface_nv12
        - Input: 640x640 NV12
        - Classes: Person, Face
        - Output: FLOAT32, HAILO NMS(number of classes: 2, maximum bounding boxes per class: 80, maximum frame size: 3208)
    - The second stage performs facial landmarking on faces detected in the first stage
        - Netwrork: tddfa_mobilenet_v1_nv12
        - Input: 120x120 NV12
        - Output: UINT8, NC(62)
- In both stages of the AI pipeline the DSP is used to crop and resize the image before inference is performed

Seeing the Other Streams
========================

In `Running the Application`_, we saw how to see the inference overlay stream. 
If you want to see the other streams (HD & SD), you simply need to open more streaming pipelines on the host machine.

Each stream is output on a different port, so you will need to open a new pipeline for each stream you want to see.
Note that in the streaming pipeline shown before targets a specific port (port=5000). 
To target another port, you will need to change the port number in the pipeline and run it separately.
The application outputs streams to the following port numbers:

- HD Stream: 5002
- SD Stream: 5004
- 4K Stream: 5000

For example, to display the HD stream run the following ajusted pipeline on the host machine:
    
        .. code-block:: bash
    
            $ gst-launch-1.0 udpsrc port=5002 address=10.0.0.2 ! application/x-rtp,encoding-name=H264 ! 
            queue max-size-buffers=30 max-size-bytes=0 max-size-time=0 leaky=no ! rtpjitterbuffer mode=0 ! 
            queue max-size-buffers=30 max-size-bytes=0 max-size-time=0 leaky=no ! rtph264depay ! 
            queue max-size-buffers=30 max-size-bytes=0 max-size-time=0 leaky=no ! h264parse ! avdec_h264 ! 
            queue max-size-buffers=30 max-size-bytes=0 max-size-time=0 leaky=downstream ! videoconvert n-threads=8 ! 
            queue max-size-buffers=30 max-size-bytes=0 max-size-time=0 leaky=no ! fpsdisplaysink text-overlay=false sync=false
